#### Notes
- It was implemented location.get.speed; however, it couldn’t be tested due to incompatibilities. location.getlatitude() and location.getlongitude() always returned the correct values, but location.getspeed() always stayed at 0. 
- It wasn´t included any music in this application, because it was implemented the MediaStorage. The media player will work with the music already existing on the device.  
- This application was developed using the university device, which is an older version. It is not fully compatible with some modern Android APIs.
